# Hand Gesture Detection and Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks and OpenCV
 
## Description: The primary goal of the project is to create a system that can identify human generated gestures and use this information for machine control.

### INTRODUCTION:
- As computer technology continues to develop, people have smaller and smaller electronic devices.
- Increasingly we are recognizing the importance of human computing interaction (HCI), and particular vision-based gesture and object recognition.
- Gestures used for communication between people and machines too.
- Building natural interaction between human and computer required accurate hand gesture recognition system as an interface for easily human computer interaction (HCI).
- Gestures can be static (posture) or dynamic (sequence of postures).
- The visual based human computer interaction is probably the most widespread area in HCI research.
